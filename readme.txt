Project Overview :

Deep Learning + Streamlit + Hugging Face Spaces

This is a Sentiment Analysis Web App which is build through deep learning techniques LSTM/GRU.
An interactive web application that predicts whether a given text expresses a Positive üòä 
or Negative üò° sentiment using a deep learning model trained on labeled sentiment data. 

Model Details : 

Model Type: LSTM /GRU a hybrid model 
Saved as: sentiment_analysis_model.h
Tokenizer: Saved as tokenizer.pickle
Input Shape: Padded sequences of 200 tokens
Output: Binary classification ‚Üí Positive (1) or Negative (0)

üìå Features :

‚úÖ Real-time Sentiment Prediction ‚Äî Enter any text and get instant results
‚úÖ Streamlit-based UI ‚Äî Simple, responsive, and user-friendly
‚úÖ TensorFlow Model ‚Äî Deep learning model trained on text data
‚úÖ Tokenizer Integration ‚Äî Same tokenizer used during training for accurate predictions
‚úÖ Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces ‚Äî Accessible from anywhere

Installation & Usage :

Follow these steps to run the app locally
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/<your-username>/sentiment-analysis-app
cd sentiment-analysis-app

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app/app.py
Now open like this http (http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
